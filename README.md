# covid_19_dashboard_pbi
An interactive and visual exploration of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination progress using Power BI.

## 📌 Project Description

This project showcases a multi-page Power BI dashboard built using publicly available COVID-19 data from **WHO** and **Our World in Data**.  
It’s designed to provide clear, insightful views into the pandemic's trends across countries, with filters and visuals for deep exploration.

No code was used — this dashboard was built entirely in Power BI using drag-and-drop visualizations and Power Query for data modeling.
